# LMM-ConceptExplainer-VQA

This project demonstrates a **concept-based explainability framework** for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) using the VQAv2-small dataset. It adapts techniques inspired by the paper *"A Concept-Based Explainability Framework for Large Multimodal Models"* to provide interpretable visual question answering (VQA) outputs by analyzing how specific words in answers are represented across text and vision modalities.

---

## 📌 Objective

To identify and explain key entities (concepts) from VQA answers using both textual and visual embeddings extracted via a Large Multimodal Model (LMM), and to assess their stability and representational utility.

---

## 📂 Dataset

- **Name**: [VQAv2-small](https://huggingface.co/datasets/vqa)
- Accessed via HuggingFace's `datasets` library.
- A lightweight version of the VQAv2 dataset used for development and experimentation.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

1. Extract answers from a subset of the VQAv2 dataset.
2. Identify and select 5 frequently occurring target entities (e.g., “dog”, “clock”, “woman”).
3. Use a pretrained LMM (e.g., CLIP or BLIP) to extract:
   - **Textual embeddings** of the selected words.
   - **Visual embeddings** from images whose answers contain those words.
4. Visualize embeddings and compare alignment between text and image representations.
5. Evaluate each entity’s:
   - **Utility**: How meaningfully the entity is represented.
   - **Stability**: How consistently the entity is represented across samples.

## 🧠 Concept-Based Explainability

This project implements a concept-based explanation approach, inspired by research that seeks to understand *how multimodal models internally represent human-interpretable concepts*.

### 🧩 Key Concepts

#### 1. **Entity Selection**
- Identify 5 target words/entities from the answers dataset.
- These words become the *concepts* whose representations are analyzed.

#### 2. **Representation Extraction**
- For each entity:
  - **Textual Representation**: From the model's text encoder (e.g., the word "dog").
  - **Visual Representation**: From visual encoder using images where the answer includes the word.

#### 3. **Concept Verification**
- Use cosine similarity and dimensionality reduction to verify that:
  - Images associated with the same word produce similar embeddings.
  - These are close to the word’s text embedding.

#### 4. **Utility Evaluation**
- Check if representations are:
  - **Distinct**: Do different concepts have clearly separated embeddings?
  - **Cohesive**: Are instances of the same concept tightly clustered?

#### 5. **Stability Check**
- Analyze the variance in representations of the same entity across multiple samples.
- Determine how sensitive concept embeddings are to input variations.
