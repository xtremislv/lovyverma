# Career Crafters: Interview Analysis System


## 📌 Introduction
In today's competitive job market, excelling in interviews is crucial. The **Career Crafters Interview Analysis System** is an AI-powered platform designed to simulate interviews, assess both verbal and non-verbal communication skills, and provide detailed feedback to improve performance.

This system evaluates:
- **Audio Communication** (speech fluency, articulation, pauses)
- **Body Language** (posture, gestures)
- **Facial Expressions** (confidence indicators)

🔗 **GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/xtremislv/career-crafter-interview-service

## 📊 Key Functionalities

### 🎤 Audio Processing
- **Preprocessing:** Enhance signal quality (noise reduction, normalization).
- **Feature Extraction:** Analyze speech rate, articulation, and pause duration.
- **Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR):** Use Google's Speech-to-Text API for transcription.

### 📹 Video Processing
- **Body Pose Estimation:** Analyze posture using the MediaPipe library.
- **Facial Expression Analysis:** Evaluate emotions and confidence using DeepFace and OpenCV.
- **Confidence Prediction:** Integrate audio and video analysis for a comprehensive confidence score.

### 📋 Prompt Generation
- **User Profile Input:** Customize prompts based on user data (education, profession).
- **Dynamic Prompt Generation:** Use Natural Language Generation (NLG) to create contextually relevant prompts.

## 🛠️ System Pipeline
1. **User Registration & Login** – Secure authentication using Django.
2. **User Data Collection** – Collect job-related inputs to tailor interview prompts.
3. **Prompt Generation & Selection** – Generate and display personalized interview prompts.
4. **Interview Simulation** – Record and analyze user responses (audio & video).
5. **Analysis & Feedback** – Provide detailed evaluation on verbal and non-verbal cues.
